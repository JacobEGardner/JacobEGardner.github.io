Gardner, and I’m a MD/MPH student at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio. I’m set to graduate in Spring 2025, at which point I hope to match into a general surgery residency program. My professional and academic interests revolve around vaccine-preventable cancers and expanding vaccination efforts as a means to address domestic and global health disparities. To that end, I have been involved in research on human papillomavirus and cervical cancer among Cambodian women since 2018.\nOn this website, you will find a selection of my academic works, including peer-reviewed journal articles and poster presentations. You will also find news and updates on my current research projects, as well as information on upcoming events and conferences where I will be speaking. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects."

My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."
