# Welcome to my website!

My name is Jacob E. Gardner, and I'm a MD/MPH student at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio. I'm set to graduate in Spring 2025, at which point I hope to match into a general surgery residency program. My professional and academic interests revolve around vaccine-preventable cancers and expanding vaccination efforts as a means to address domestic and global health disparities. To that end, I have been involved in research on human papillomavirus and cervical cancer among Cambodian women since 2018. 

On this website, you will find a selection of my academic works, including peer-reviewed journal articles and poster presentations. You will also find news and updates on my current research projects, as well as information on upcoming events and conferences where I will be speaking. Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:jeg153@case.edu) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.
